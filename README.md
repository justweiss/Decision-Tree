# Decision Tree

A [Decision Tree](https://www.javatpoint.com/machine-learning-decision-tree-classification-algorithm) represents a function that takes as input a vector of attribute values and returns a “decision”—a single output value.

This program implements the decision tree learning algorithm from Artificial Intelligence, A Modern Approach chapter 18.




    RUN: python3 decisionTree.py
    
   It will then ask you a set of questions, it will give you a set of options to the right. Based off the questions it will tell you to wait or leave
        
        Example: Patrons?  ['Full', 'None', 'Some']
            You would enter Full or full (the first letter is not case sensitive)

 
> Note: This program requires python3, pandas, numpy, and pprint, without these libraries the program will not run.
